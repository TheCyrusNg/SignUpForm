# SignUpForm
CIS 3515: Lab 2
This lab is about a sign up form, that takes in the user's name, email, password, and to also confirm their password. There is a "save" button at the bottom to take in the 
user's parameters and checks to make sure that none of the fields are empty. If any of the fields are empty a errer message will be displayed. Also if the password and
confirm password are not the same an error message will also be displayed as well. If all fields have no errors, then a toast message with a welcome message will be displayed.
